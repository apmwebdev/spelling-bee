        definition hints for the following words: arrow, arrowroot, athwart, away,
        awry, harrow, thataway, thaw, throw, throwaway, thwart, wahoo, wart, warty,
        wary, watt, what, whoa, woot, worry\n Respond in JSON format. There should
        be an outer object containing an array with the key \"word_hints\". The array
        should contain an object for each word. The keys in this object should be
        \"word\", which contains the word itself, and \"hint\", which contains your
        hint. An example of this format would be: {word_hints:[{word:\"aioli\",hint:\"Hint
        text for ''aioli''\"},{word:\"alit\",hint:\"Hint text for ''alit''\"}]}\n\nEach
        hint should be one or two sentences and should not contain any form of the
        word you''re providing a hint for, or any word or phrase that the submitted
        word can be an abbreviation for. For example, the hint for \"allay\" should
        not contain \"allay,\" \"allaying,\" \"allays,\" etc. The hints should focus
        on the meaning of the word, although hints about the pronunciation are also
        acceptable. These hints are designed to replicate the user-provided hints
        that users provide on the New York Times Spelling Bee forums for words in
        that day''s Spelling Bee puzzle.\n\nPlease respond only with the JSON object
        and nothing else.\n"}],"response_format":{"type":"json_object"}}'
