        definition hints for the following words: aioli, alit, allay, allot, alloy,
        ally, alto, atilt, atoll, avail, iota, laity, lava, loyal, loyally, loyalty,
        oaty, oval, tail, tali\n Respond in JSON format. There should be an outer
        object containing an array with the key \"word_hints\". The array should contain
        an object for each word. The keys in this object should be \"word\", which
        contains the word itself, and \"hint\", which contains your hint. An example
        of this format would be: {word_hints:[{word:\"aioli\",hint:\"Hint text for
        ''aioli''\"},{word:\"alit\",hint:\"Hint text for ''alit''\"}]}\n\nEach hint
        should be one or two sentences and should not contain any form of the word
        you''re providing a hint for, or any word or phrase that the submitted word
        can be an abbreviation for. For example, the hint for \"allay\" should not
        contain \"allay,\" \"allaying,\" \"allays,\" etc. The hints should focus on
        the meaning of the word, although hints about the pronunciation are also acceptable.
        These hints are designed to replicate the user-provided hints that users provide
        on the New York Times Spelling Bee forums for words in that day''s Spelling
        Bee puzzle.\n\nPlease respond only with the JSON object and nothing else.\n"}],"response_format":{"type":"json_object"}}'
