        hint. An example of this format would be: {word_hints:[{word:\"aioli\",hint:\"Hint

        word can be an abbreviation for. For example, the hint for \"allay\" should
        not contain \"allay,\" \"allaying,\" \"allays,\" etc. The hints should focus
        on the meaning of the word, although hints about the pronunciation are also
        acceptable. These hints are designed to replicate the user-provided hints
